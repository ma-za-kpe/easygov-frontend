# WaziGov ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

**WaziGov** is a platform that empowers women and marginalized communities in Uganda by transforming complex government documents, such as budget papers, into clear, concise summaries. Available in English and Swahili (with plans for Luganda), these summaries highlight gender equality and social inclusion, aligning with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 5 and SDG 10). WaziGov also supports fact-checking and is developing voice transcription to ensure accessibility for users with low literacy or visual impairments.

**Tagline:** *Simplifying Rights for Women, Loud and Clear*
